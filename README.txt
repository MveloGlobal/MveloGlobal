---------------------------------------

Files in this folder:
- index.html

Quick hosting instructions (free):
1) GitHub Pages:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub, upload these files to the repository root (or 'gh-pages' branch).
   - In repository settings > Pages, set the source to main branch (root). Your site will be available at https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>.

2) Netlify:
   - Drag and drop the zip folder or the built folder into Netlify's deploy UI (app.netlify.com).
   - Netlify will host it at a free .netlify.app domain. Add a custom domain if you have one.

3) Vercel:
   - Create a new project in Vercel and import the GitHub repo, or drag the folder into Vercel.
   - Vercel gives a free .vercel.app domain.
